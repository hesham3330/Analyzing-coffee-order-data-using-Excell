### First Step: Data collection,Cleaning and EDA
I began the project by gathering all relevant data into a single, well-structured worksheet known as the "Order Sheet." To accomplish this, I utilized advanced Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH, which allowed me to accurately extract and combine data. This consolidation step was essential for ensuring that all necessary information was available in one place, facilitating consistent and efficient analysis.

After successfully compiling the data, I focused on data cleaning and restructuring. This phase involved identifying and removing duplicate records, addressing missing or inconsistent values, and standardizing data formats to ensure consistency. I also rearranged columns and applied filters to make the dataset easier to navigate and ready for analysis. These steps guaranteed that the data was clean, reliable, and prepared for deeper exploration.

With the cleaned and organized dataset ready, I proceeded to the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA). During this stage, I examined the data for general trends, patterns, and potential outliers. This analysis included evaluating order volumes, identifying seasonal patterns, and exploring customer behavior over time. The insights gained during this phase provided a solid foundation for more detailed analysis in the subsequent stages of the project.

### Second step: Analyzing Using Pivot Tables

I then utilized Pivot Tables to summarize and explore the data from multiple perspectives. Pivot Tables were instrumental in allowing me to quickly group, filter, and aggregate data, which provided valuable overviews such as total Sales by Kind, total Sales by Country, Top Customer, and monthly revenue trends. This step not only streamlined my analysis but also uncovered key relationships and patterns in the data.

### Third step: Dashboard Design and Final Delivery

After completing the analysis, I designed an interactive Excel Dashboard to visually present the key insights. I focused on displaying essential KPIs, such as total sales by product kind, top customers, and monthly revenue trends, using charts and slicers for interactivity. The dashboard was organized with a clean layout, consistent color schemes, and drop-down filters, allowing stakeholders to easily explore and interpret the data. The final result was a user-friendly and informative dashboard that streamlined decision-making
